PROLOGUE (“Uneasy”)
The player wakes up and looks around, confused.
Player: "Where... Am I?"
Player is given control and walks to the right, entering a cemetery. At the end, he kneels and sees his own name on a gravestone.
Player: "Is this..."
???: "Yes, it was."
A spirit appears from off-screen and introduces itself as "The Guide of Souls," and begins to explain the situation.
Player: "W-who..."
GoS: "I am merely a humble guide, for souls such as yourself."
Player: "Does this mean...?"
GoS: "Yes. You are dead."
Player; "Dead...?"
GoS: "Dead."
Player: "Who... who am... who was I?"
GoS: "You don't know?"
The player shakes his head.
GoS: "I suppose it's up to you to find out for yourself."
Player: "Could you help me?"
GoS: "I ... could try."
Player: "Where do I start?"
GoS: "Your guess is as good as mine, this is my first week on the job. Let's get out of here though, this place gives me the creeps."
